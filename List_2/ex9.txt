mlocate's main feature, from which it gets its name ("merging locate"): It provides a version of updatedb that reuses its old index to improve update performance by only querying lists of files/subdirectories for directories where the ctime has changed

mlocate - show paths of files that match the pattern

    - i - case insensitive
    - c - count files
    - b - pattern must be at the end
    - l NUMBER - limit number of results to NUMBER

updatedb creates or updates a database used by locate(1). If the database already exists, its data is reused to avoid rereading directories that have not changed.
updatedb is usually run daily by cron(8) to update the default database.

sudo updatedb

Kpathsea is a library for path searching (e.g., for very quickly locating a given .sty file in a set of potentially large TEXMF trees, without doing a recursive directory tree traversal every time a given file is needed; this is important when compiling LaTeX documents using several packages, themselves requiring other packages, possibly various font files, etc.).

 kpsewhich is more sophisticated than a typical which builtin, though, as it can return different results depending on what was given as -progname, has a notion of variables that can be set in texmf.cnf, can look up in-cache-only or on-disk depending on the per-directory-settings in texmf.cnf, etc.
