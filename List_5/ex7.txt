netstat  -  Print network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, masquerade connections, and multi‐
       cast memberships

netstat - active tcp connections
netstat -r - routing tables
netstat -i - network interfaces

 lsof -Ua      The -a option may be used to AND the selections.  For example,
       specifying -a, -U, and -ufoo produces a listing of only UNIX
       socket files that belong to processes owned by use (get PID)

netstat -p (--program) -  Show the PID and name of the program to which each socket belongs. 

netstat -p (--program) | grep PID - show program name




The ss (socket statistics) tool is a CLI command used to show network statistics. The ss command is a simpler and faster version of the now obsolete netstat command. Together with the ip command, ss is essential for gathering network information and troubleshooting network issues.
ss - returns a list of open non-listening sockets with established connections.
The columns show the following details:

    Netid – Type of socket. Common types are TCP, UDP, u_str (Unix stream), and u_seq (Unix sequence).
    State – State of the socket. Most commonly ESTAB (established), UNCONN (unconnected), LISTEN (listening).
    Recv-Q – Number of received packets in the queue.
    Send-Q – Number of sent packets in the queue.
    Local address:port – Address of local machine and port.
    Peer address:port – Address of remote machine and port.

ss --all - List all listening and non-listening connections with:

ss --listen - To display only listening sockets, which are omitted by default, use:

ss -s - statistics

lsof -U - all unix sockets
