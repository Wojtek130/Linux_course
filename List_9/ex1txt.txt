sysVinit -> Updsart -> systemd

- Any change that  the Linux ecosystem makes, especially if it’s not backward compatible, impacts nearly everyone running a Linux machine.

Some notable examples are:

-systemd absorbing udev (system plików)
-Introducing a change that kills background processes when a user logs out by default.
-GNOME making systemd a hard-dependency and preventing any non-systemd systems from using it. (It’s possible to run GNOME without systemd by requires lots of workarounds.)

The last, and perhaps largest, reason I see for complaints about systemd is that it is a significant change from its predecessors. Both in implementation and philosophy.

The UNIX philosophy states that everything tool should do one thing and do it very well. While Poettering is quick to point out that systemd is a collection of binaries, many of the binaries depend on one another, not making it as decoupled and modular as advertised.

systemd doesn’t abide by the POSIX standard
